Furthermore, it provides the alarms set on your Somneo instance as binary sensors and provides a sensor with the first upcoming alarm.

# Services
This component includes two services to adjust the wake-up light and sound settings. To adjust the light settings of an alarm you can call the following function:
```
service: somneo.set_light_alarm
target:
  entity_id: switch.somneo_alarm0
data:
  curve: sunny day
  level: 20
  duration: 30
```
The curve is either `sunny day`, `island red` or `nordic white`. Level should be between 0 and 25 and duration betweeen 4 and 40 minutes.

To adjust the sound settings of an alarm you can call the following function:
```
service: somneo.set_sound_alarm
target:
  entity_id: switch.somneo_alarm0
data:
  source: wake-up
  channel: forest birds
  level: 10
```
The source is `wake-up` for the wake-up sounds, `radio` for the FM radio of `off` for no sound. If the wake-up sound is selected, channel is one of the following sounds: `forest birds`, `summer birds`, `morning alps`, `yoga harmony`, `nepal bowls`, `summer lake` or `ocean waves`. If the radio is selected, channel has a value 1 till 5 (formatted as a string). The level should be between 1 and 25.

PowerWake can be set for an alarm with:
```
service: somneo.set_powerwake
target:
  entity_id: switch.somneo_alarm0
data:
  state: on
  delta: 10
```
State is either `on` or `off`, and determines whether PowerWake is enabled or disabled for the alarm.
The delay in minutes between alarm start and PowerWake is configured with `delta`. Delta should be between 0 and 59. Setting `delta` to 0 will start PowerWake immediately when alarm starts.

Furthermore, alarms can be added to or removed from the list in the Somneo app with:
```
service: somneo.add_alarm
target:
  entity_id: switch.somneo_alarm0
```
```
service: somneo.remove_alarm
target:
  entity_id: switch.somneo_alarm0
```
